git add . 
<!-- to add all the files in the staging area for commit -->
git add  <select particular name>
    <!-- to add a particular file to the staging area -->
    git commit - m "m for message to directly commit and in semicolon we can write anything"


    vi names.txt 
    to add anything to the text file that is to add something to names.txt heree

    cat names.txt  to see anything that is written in the file

    git status to see the modified files and see status

    to restore any file from the staging area lets say we want to remove names.txt from staging area than our code should be
    git restore --staged names.txt

    git log to see all the commits that have been made


    suppose you want to reset a file and want to go to the previous version of it just then use git log and copy the code of which version 
    you want and paste it with the following lke
    git reset <the code of which you want>
        and the delted files goes to the unstage area

        git stash     to keep the current code to backstage so that we dont delete it and also we dont add it

        git stash pop   to bring all the code from backstage to the staging area

        git stash clear   to remove all the code that were in the backstage and you cant bring them back again
